        <b> The Definition of Planets</b>
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 150%">
        A planet is a large astronomical body that is neither a star nor a
        stellar remnant. There are competing scientific definitions of a
        "planet". In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International
        Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive
        enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star,
        and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects. The IAU has
        also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System,
        independently of the formal definition.[a][1][2] In the geological
        definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded
        sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite.
